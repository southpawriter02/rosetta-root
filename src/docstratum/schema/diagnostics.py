"""Error code registry for the DocStratum validation engine.

Defines the complete diagnostic code catalog derived from the v0.0.1a
enrichment pass. Every validation finding references a DiagnosticCode
that includes the severity level, a human-readable message template,
and a remediation hint.

The code format follows the pattern: {SEVERITY_PREFIX}{NUMBER}
    E001-E008:  Errors (8 codes) — Structural failures that prevent valid parsing
    W001-W011:  Warnings (11 codes) — Deviations from best practices
    I001-I007:  Informational (7 codes) — Observations and suggestions

Research basis:
    v0.0.1a §Error Code Registry (enrichment pass)
    v0.0.4a §Structural Checks (ENC-001/002, STR-001-005, MD-001-003, etc.)
    v0.0.4b §Content Checks (CNT-001-015)
