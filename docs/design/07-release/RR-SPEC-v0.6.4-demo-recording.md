## Task Overview

---

## Video Script (2 Minutes)

### 0:00-0:15 — Introduction

**[Show: Title card with project name]**

> "Hi, I'm [Name], and this is The DocStratum—a semantic translation layer that makes documentation AI-ready."
> 

---

### 0:15-0:30 — The Problem

**[Show: Diagram of Context Collapse]**

> "AI agents struggle with documentation websites. They get lost in navigation, confuse definitions with marketing copy, and hallucinate when they can't find answers."
> 

---

### 0:30-0:45 — The Solution

**[Show: llms.txt file structure]**

> "The DocStratum is a hand-crafted llms.txt file—a master index with concept definitions, relationships, and few-shot examples that teach the AI how to answer."
> 

---

### 0:45-1:15 — Live Demo

**[Show: Streamlit app]**

> "Let me show you the difference. I'll ask both a baseline AI and a DocStratum-enhanced AI the same question."
> 

**[Type: "Should I use OAuth2 or API keys for my server script?"]**

**[Click: Compare button]**

> "The baseline gives generic advice. But the DocStratum agent gives a specific recommendation, cites the anti-pattern, and links directly to the documentation."
> 

---

### 1:15-1:45 — Results

**[Show: Validation results table]**

> "I ran three validation tests. The DocStratum agent passed all three—disambiguation, freshness awareness, and format adherence. The baseline failed to provide specific, actionable answers."
>

### 1:45-2:00 — Conclusion

**[Show: GitHub repo URL]**

> "The DocStratum proves that better structure beats more code. Check out the repo at [URL]. Thanks for watching!"
