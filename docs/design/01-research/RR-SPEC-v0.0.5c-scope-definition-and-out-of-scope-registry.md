# v0.0.5c — Scope Definition & Out-of-Scope Registry

> **Sub-Part:** Define rigid scope boundaries, catalog out-of-scope items with detailed justifications, provide a "Scope Fence" decision tree for evaluating new ideas, and establish scope change management process.

---

## Sub-Part Overview

This sub-part complements v0.0.5a (Functional Requirements) and v0.0.5b (Non-Functional Requirements & Constraints) by drawing a hard perimeter around the v0.6.0 MVP — defining not only what DocStratum IS, but rigorously cataloging what it IS NOT and providing operational tooling to keep it that way during implementation. Drawing on scope risks surfaced across all four research phases — v0.0.1 (specification gaps inviting feature creep), v0.0.2 (wild variation suggesting unbounded scope), v0.0.3 (75+ ecosystem tools tempting integration sprawl), and v0.0.4 (best practices creating "nice-to-have" gravity) — this document establishes a formal scope defense system comprising 32 out-of-scope items (OOS-A1 through OOS-G5) across 7 exclusion categories, a "Scope Fence" decision tree for real-time feature evaluation, a deferred features registry preserving 11 valuable post-MVP ideas, a 5-step scope change management process, 7 explicit exclusion statements with rationale, and 5 health metrics for ongoing scope monitoring.

**Distribution:** 3 commercial/production exclusions (Category A), 5 full-platform exclusions (Category B), 5 ecosystem integration exclusions (Category C), 5 advanced ML/AI exclusions (Category D), 5 deployment/infrastructure exclusions (Category E), 4 historical/legacy exclusions (Category F), and 5 nice-to-have exclusions (Category G). All 32 items include: what the feature is, why it's excluded, when it becomes feasible, and what would need to change. The deferred features registry captures 11 items with estimated effort (4–30 hours each) and target versions (v1.5+ through v2.0+).

**Relationship to v0.0.5a and v0.0.5b:** Every OOS item was evaluated against the 68 functional requirements from v0.0.5a to confirm it does not overlap with any MUST or SHOULD requirement. The 6 hard constraints from v0.0.5b (CONST-001 through CONST-006) directly inform the exclusion rationale — particularly CONST-001 (solo developer), CONST-002 (portfolio scope), CONST-005 (v0.6.0 target), and CONST-006 (40–60 hour budget). The Scope Fence decision tree references FR IDs and MoSCoW priorities from v0.0.5a as its first evaluation filters.

## Objective

Scope creep is a primary risk on constrained projects (solo developer, 40–60 hour budget, portfolio-focused). This sub-part establishes clear, defensible scope boundaries and provides a structured process for evaluating new ideas. By the end, everyone understands what IS DocStratum and what IS NOT, and why.

### Success Looks Like

- Crystal-clear in-scope boundary statement (what DocStratum is)
- 15+ out-of-scope items with detailed justifications (what DocStratum is not)
- "Scope Fence" decision tree (flowchart for evaluating new features)
- Deferred features registry (valuable ideas for future versions)
- Scope change management process (how to handle new requests)
- All team members (you) agree on these boundaries
- Zero scope creep during implementation

---

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- Defining the explicit in-scope boundary statement for DocStratum v0.6.0 MVP
- Cataloging out-of-scope items with detailed justifications across multiple categories
- Providing the "Scope Fence" decision tree for evaluating new feature ideas during implementation
- Building a deferred features registry for valuable post-MVP ideas
- Establishing a scope change management process to prevent ad-hoc scope expansion
- Defining explicit exclusion statements (what DocStratum is NOT)
- Providing scope health metrics for monitoring during v0.1–v0.6 implementation
- Mapping OOS items back to functional requirements (v0.0.5a) and constraints (v0.0.5b) for traceability

### Out of Scope

- Functional behavior definitions (that's v0.0.5a)
- Non-functional quality targets and constraints (that's v0.0.5b)
- Success metrics, test scenarios, or MVP pass/fail criteria (that's v0.0.5d)
- Implementation details, code design, or API signatures
- Detailed cost/benefit analysis for deferred features (those are post-MVP planning concerns)
- Third-party platform evaluations or technology selection (fixed tech stack per CONST-003)

## Part 3: Scope Fence — Decision Tree

### Evaluating New Feature Requests

When a new feature idea arises during implementation, use this decision tree to determine if it's in scope:

```
New Feature Idea Requested
    │
    ├─→ Is it listed in the Out-of-Scope Registry (OOS-A1 through OOS-G5)?
    │   ├─ YES → DECISION: Out of scope (explain category)
    │   └─ NO → Continue to next check
    │
    ├─→ Does it directly support one of the 7 main modules (v0.0.5a FR-001 through FR-065)?
    │   ├─ YES → DECISION: Likely in scope (assess priority: MUST/SHOULD/COULD)
    │   └─ NO → Continue to next check
    │
    ├─→ Does it enable the core demo or A/B testing?
    │   ├─ YES → DECISION: In scope if fits timeline
    │   └─ NO → Continue to next check
    │
    ├─→ Is it a "COULD have" per MoSCoW (nice-to-have)?
    │   ├─ YES → Only if time budget remaining > 5 hours
    │   └─ NO → Continue to next check
    │
    ├─→ Is it research-driven (justified by v0.0.1–4 findings)?
    │   ├─ YES → DECISION: Assess effort; consider deferring if > 4 hours
    │   └─ NO → Continue to next check
    │
    └─→ DEFAULT → DECISION: Out of scope; defer to post-v0.6.0 list
```

### Examples of Applying the Scope Fence

#### Example 1: Neo4j Graph Visualization

```
Question: "Should we add an interactive Neo4j graph visualization?"

Decision Tree:
├─ In OOS registry? YES → OOS-G1 (Neo4j Graph Visualization)
├─ Supports main module? NO (not in v0.0.5a requirements)
├─ Enables demo? Partially (nice visual, but not essential)
├─ COULD have? YES (NFR-062 is COULD)
├─ Research-driven? Not directly (v0.0.1c mentions concepts, but not visualization)
├─ Effort estimate? 6–8 hours for proper D3.js setup
│
└─ DECISION: Out of scope for v0.6.0
   Rationale: Defer to v1.5+ when graph visualization is critical feature
   Alternative: Use Streamlit st.graphviz_chart() for minimal graph view if time permits
```

#### Example 2: Confluence Plugin

```
Question: "Can we build a Confluence plugin to auto-generate llms.txt?"

Decision Tree:
├─ In OOS registry? YES → OOS-C2 (Integration: Confluence Plugin)
├─ Supports main module? NO (scope is platform-agnostic)
├─ Enables demo? NO
├─ COULD have? NO (not even listed as COULD)
├─ Research-driven? NO (research didn't focus on Confluence)
│
└─ DECISION: Out of scope; not in current roadmap
   Rationale: Scope is DocStratum library + Streamlit demo, not platform integrations
   Future: v1.5+ can establish plugin architecture if needed
```

#### Example 3: Streaming Parser (for Large Files)

```
Question: "Should we implement streaming/chunked parsing for >100MB files?"

Decision Tree:
├─ In OOS registry? NO
├─ Supports main module? Partially → FR-031 (COULD have streaming)
├─ Enables demo? NO (demo files are < 50KB)
├─ COULD have? YES → FR-031
├─ Research-driven? YES → v0.0.1c token budgeting
├─ Effort estimate? 3–4 hours for streaming API
├─ Time budget remaining? If > 4 hours → IN SCOPE
│
└─ DECISION: In scope IF time permits; otherwise defer
   Rationale: FR-031 is COULD; implement if core features complete early
   Alternative: Doc note "For files > 50MB, consider streaming (see FR-031)"
```

## Part 4: Deferred Features Registry

### Valuable Ideas for Future Versions

These are features that were considered valuable but are out of scope for v0.6.0 due to timeline/complexity. They are candidates for future versions (v1.0+).

| Feature | Category | Priority | Estimated Effort | Target Version | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Embeddings + semantic search | ML | SHOULD | 8–12 hours | v1.5+ | Improves context relevance; requires vector DB setup |
| Web-based editor | Platform | SHOULD | 10–15 hours | v1.5+ | Enables collaborative llms.txt creation; requires deployment |
| Neo4j visualization | UI | COULD | 6–8 hours | v1.5+ | Visually impressive; not essential for MVP |
| Documentation auto-generation | AI | SHOULD | 12–20 hours | v1.5+ | Valuable but requires fine-tuning; manual extraction works for MVP |
| Real-time sync with source docs | Integration | SHOULD | 15–25 hours | v2.0+ | Complex; requires per-platform connectors |
| Multi-language support | Localization | COULD | 10–15 hours | v2.0+ | Nice-to-have; focus on English ecosystem first |
| GraphQL API | Backend | COULD | 8–12 hours | v1.5+ | Production feature; REST/CLI sufficient for MVP |
| Docker/Kubernetes | Deployment | SHOULD | 6–10 hours | v1.5+ | For production; local dev + Streamlit sufficient for portfolio |
| Slack Bot integration | Integration | COULD | 4–6 hours | v1.5+ | Fun but not essential; web demo covers use cases |
| Performance benchmarking suite | QA | SHOULD | 4–6 hours | v1.5+ | Nice-to-have; basic latency testing covers MVP |
| LLM fine-tuning | AI | COULD | 20–30 hours | v2.0+ | Advanced; base models sufficient for MVP |

## Part 5: Scope Change Management Process

### How to Handle New Requests (During Implementation)

If new requirements arise during v0.1–v0.6 implementation, follow this process:

#### Step 1: Document the Request

- **Source:** Who requested it (you, feedback, discovery)?
- **Title:** Clear name for the feature
- **Description:** What does it do?
- **Effort Estimate:** Rough hours needed (1–2 hours for a rough estimate)
- **Impact:** How does it affect existing features?

#### Step 2: Apply Scope Fence

Run the new feature through the Scope Fence decision tree (Part 3). Result:

- **Clearly In Scope:** Implement as part of the module
- **Clearly Out of Scope:** Add to Deferred Features Registry; document rationale
- **Ambiguous:** Escalate to Step 3

#### Step 3: Escalate (If Ambiguous)

If unclear, answer these questions:

1. **Does it advance the core research goal** (proving DocStratum improves agent performance)?
   - YES → Likely in scope
   - NO → Likely out of scope
2. **Can we deliver v0.6.0 MVP without it?**
   - YES → Probably out of scope for MVP (defer or COULD)
   - NO → Probably in scope
3. **Is estimated effort < 2 hours?**
   - YES → Consider adding as COULD if time permits
   - NO → Defer to post-v0.6.0

#### Step 4: Decision

- **APPROVED:** Add to implementation backlog; estimate effort; assign to appropriate module
- **DEFERRED:** Add to Deferred Features Registry with target future version
- **REJECTED:** Document rationale in rejected features log (for portfolio review)

#### Step 5: Log the Decision

Keep a "Scope Change Log" file documenting:

```
Date: 2026-02-XX
Feature: [Title]
Request From: [Source]
Decision: [APPROVED / DEFERRED / REJECTED]
Effort: [Hours]
Rationale: [Brief explanation]
```

## Part 6: Explicit Exclusions with Justifications

### What DocStratum IS NOT

1. **Not a replacement for the official llms.txt spec**
   - Justification: Official spec is stable; DocStratum extends it
   - How we handle it: Maintain full backward compatibility; reference official spec in all docs

2. **Not a commercial product**
   - Justification: Portfolio project; no monetization
   - How we handle it: Open source; community-driven; free forever

3. **Not a full RAG system**
   - Justification: RAG is complex; DocStratum provides structured context (simpler, sufficient)
   - How we handle it: Document how DocStratum integrates with RAG pipelines post-MVP

4. **Not an LLM platform**
   - Justification: We use existing APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic); don't train models
   - How we handle it: Abstract LLM provider via LiteLLM; support multiple models

5. **Not a documentation platform**
   - Justification: Too many platforms; we provide tools, not hosting
   - How we handle it: Reference implementations for Stripe, Nuxt, etc.; enable others to host

6. **Not a real-time collaboration tool**
   - Justification: Collaboration is complex; focus on individual use
   - How we handle it: Document how DocStratum integrates with Google Docs, Notion, etc.

7. **Not a machine learning research project**
   - Justification: We use off-the-shelf models; don't do research on new architectures
   - How we handle it: Focus on empirical testing of existing approaches

---

## Part 7: Scope Metrics & Health Checks

### Tracking Scope Throughout Implementation

Every 2 weeks, check:

| Metric | Target | Action if Failed |
|---|---|---|
| **Approved out-of-scope items documented** | ≥ 15 | Review decision tree; ensure clarity |
| **Deferred features in registry** | ≥ 5 | Ensure valuable ideas aren't lost |
| **Scope change requests handled** | ≤ 1 per week | If > 1/week, scope boundary might be unclear |
| **Estimated effort overrun** | ≤ 5% | If > 5%, modules need re-estimation |
| **Feature scope drift** | 0 items added to MVP | If any drift detected, apply decision tree immediately |

---

## Part 8: OOS-to-FR Traceability

### Objective

Every out-of-scope item exists in relation to one or more functional requirements from v0.0.5a. Some OOS items represent features that were considered and rejected; others represent extensions of existing FRs that exceed the v0.6.0 boundary. This matrix establishes bidirectional traceability so that during implementation, any "why didn't we include X?" question has a documented answer.

### Category A (Commercial) → FR Mapping

| OOS Item | Related FRs | Relationship | Rationale for Exclusion |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| OOS-A1 (SaaS Platform) | FR-059–065 (Demo Layer) | Extension beyond | Demo is local Streamlit; SaaS requires deployment infra beyond CONST-002 (portfolio scope) |
| OOS-A2 (Commercial Licensing) | None directly | Orthogonal | Business concern, not functional requirement; CONST-002 makes this irrelevant |
| OOS-A3 (Premium Tiers) | FR-064 (Settings Panel) | Extension beyond | Settings are local config; premium tiers require user auth and payment — exceeds CONST-006 (time budget) |

### Category B (Platforms) → FR Mapping

| OOS Item | Related FRs | Relationship | Rationale for Exclusion |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| OOS-B1 (Web Editor) | FR-059 (Streamlit UI) | Extension beyond | Streamlit is read-only demo; full editor requires JS frontend — exceeds CONST-003 (fixed tech stack) |
| OOS-B2 (Real-Time Sync) | FR-026 (Loader), FR-030 (Cache) | Extension beyond | Loader handles file/URL input; sync requires per-platform connectors — exceeds CONST-006 |
| OOS-B3 (Auto-Generation) | FR-020 (Few-Shot Bank), FR-016 (Concept Map) | Inverse approach | DocStratum validates/enriches; auto-generation requires domain-specific knowledge extraction |
| OOS-B4 (Full RAG) | FR-035 (Query-Aware Selection), FR-046 (Retrieval Strategy) | Extension beyond | FR-046 includes keyword + hybrid search; full RAG requires vector DB — exceeds scope |
| OOS-B5 (GraphQL API) | FR-025 (JSON/YAML Export) | Extension beyond | Export covers serialization; GraphQL requires API server infra — exceeds CONST-002 |

### Category C (Ecosystem Integration) → FR Mapping

| OOS Item | Related FRs | Relationship | Rationale for Exclusion |

### Category D (Advanced ML) → FR Mapping

| OOS Item | Related FRs | Relationship | Rationale for Exclusion |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| OOS-D1 (Embeddings) | FR-046 (Retrieval Strategy) | Extension beyond | FR-046 includes keyword + hybrid; embeddings require vector DB — COULD for post-MVP |

## Part 9: Research-to-OOS Traceability

### Objective

Every out-of-scope decision is informed by research evidence from v0.0.1–v0.0.4. This section traces which research findings justify specific exclusion decisions, ensuring that scope boundaries are evidence-grounded rather than arbitrary.

### Research Phase → OOS Mapping

| Research Phase | Key Finding | OOS Items Informed | How It Informs Exclusion |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| v0.0.1 (Spec Deep Dive) | Official spec is stable; no versioning mechanism exists | OOS-F2 (Old Versions) | No legacy versions to support — exclusion is definitional |
| v0.0.1 (Spec Deep Dive) | 8 specification gaps identified (no validation, no schema, no quality metrics) | OOS-D5 (LLM Validator) | Gaps justify rule-based validation; LLM validation is an alternative approach, not a gap fill |
| v0.0.1c (Processing Methods) | 8K curated tokens outperforms 200K raw | OOS-B4 (Full RAG) | Structured context is sufficient; full RAG is overkill for the proven token budget model |
| v0.0.2 (Wild Examples) | File sizes range 159 bytes to 3.7M tokens | OOS-E4 (Horizontal Scaling) | Typical files are <50KB; scaling is a production concern, not a portfolio concern |
| v0.0.2 (Wild Examples) | 0% LLM Instructions adoption across 18 implementations | OOS-D2 (Fine-Tuned LLM) | No training data exists for llms.txt understanding; base models must suffice |
| v0.0.3 (Ecosystem Survey) | 75+ tools found; zero provide formal validation or scoring | OOS-C1–C5 (Integrations) | Ecosystem is fragmented; integrating with any single platform is wrong investment |
| v0.0.3 (Ecosystem Survey) | Adoption Paradox: grassroots adoption, zero search LLM consumption | OOS-A1–A3 (Commercial) | No validated revenue pathway; commercial products are premature |
| v0.0.3 (Ecosystem Survey) | MCP is the only validated consumption pathway | OOS-B5 (GraphQL API), OOS-C5 (Slack Bot) | API and bot integrations target wrong consumption model; MCP is the channel |
| v0.0.4 (Best Practices) | 57 automated checks define the quality surface area | OOS-D5 (LLM Validator) | Rule-based checks are deterministic and sufficient; LLM judge adds non-determinism |
| v0.0.4 (Best Practices) | 100-point composite scoring pipeline validated against gold standards | OOS-G3 (Analytics Dashboard) | Scoring pipeline exists; analytics dashboard is a presentation layer, not a quality concern |
| v0.0.4d (Differentiators) | DECISION-015: AI coding assistants via MCP as primary target | OOS-B1 (Web Editor), OOS-G5 (Mobile App) | Target audience uses IDEs, not web editors or mobile apps |
| v0.0.4d (Differentiators) | DECISION-013: Token budgets as first-class constraint | OOS-D3 (Multi-Modal) | Token budgets are text-calibrated; multi-modal content breaks the budgeting model |

## Part 11: Outputs to Next Sub-Part

| Output | Consumed By | How It's Used |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| 32 out-of-scope items (OOS-A1 through OOS-G5) | v0.0.5d (Success Criteria & MVP) | Defines what is explicitly excluded from MVP pass/fail criteria — if a feature appears in OOS, it cannot be a success criterion |
| In-scope boundary statement (Part 1) | v0.0.5d (Success Criteria) | The 9 in-scope deliverables become the basis for the MVP Definition of Done checklist |
| Deferred features registry (Part 4, 11 items) | v0.0.5d (Success Criteria) | Stretch goals in v0.0.5d are drawn from deferred features with lowest effort estimates |
| Scope Fence decision tree (Part 3) | v0.0.5d (Success Criteria) | Test scenarios in v0.0.5d reference the Scope Fence to validate that the demo covers only in-scope features |
| Scope change management process (Part 5) | v0.1.0+ (Implementation) | Active governance tool used throughout v0.1–v0.6 to evaluate any new feature idea before implementation |
| OOS-to-FR traceability (Part 8) | v0.1.0+ (Implementation) | When implementing a FR, developers can check if any related OOS items were considered and rejected — preventing accidental scope creep |
| Scope health metrics (Part 7) | v0.1.0+ (Implementation) | Biweekly scope health checks use these metrics to detect early signs of scope drift |

---

## Part 12: Limitations & Constraints

1. **OOS items are version-scoped, not permanent exclusions.** Every OOS item includes a "When Feasible" column indicating the version at which the feature becomes viable. The Deferred Features Registry (Part 4) captures the most valuable items with effort estimates for future planning. Exclusion from v0.6.0 does not imply the feature lacks value.

2. **Effort estimates in the Deferred Features Registry are rough.** The 4–30 hour estimates are order-of-magnitude approximations based on research-phase understanding. Actual effort may vary significantly once implementation context is available. These estimates should be refined during post-MVP planning, not used for scheduling.

3. **The Scope Fence decision tree is a heuristic, not an algorithm.** The tree provides structured guidance for evaluating new ideas, but ambiguous cases will arise. The escalation path (Part 5, Step 3) handles edge cases, but ultimately the developer (solo, per CONST-001) makes the final call. The tree reduces decision fatigue; it doesn't eliminate judgment.

4. **Category boundaries are pragmatic, not taxonomic.** Some OOS items could belong to multiple categories (e.g., OOS-D1 "Embeddings" could be Category B "Platform" or Category D "Advanced ML"). The assigned category reflects the primary reason for exclusion, not a formal classification system.

5. **Scope health metrics assume biweekly review cadence.** The metrics in Part 7 are designed for a sprint-style review cycle. If implementation proceeds in a different rhythm (e.g., daily bursts, weekly marathons), the monitoring cadence should adjust accordingly. The key is consistent review, not the specific interval.

6. **The OOS-to-FR traceability (Part 8) is not exhaustive.** Each OOS item is mapped to the most directly related FRs. Some OOS items have tangential relationships to additional FRs that are not captured. The mapping prioritizes clarity over completeness — the goal is to answer "why was this excluded?" not "what else could this have touched?"

## Part 13: User Stories

> As a **solo developer building DocStratum**, I need clearly defined scope boundaries with a structured decision process so that when I'm mid-implementation and think "wouldn't it be cool to also add X?" I have a documented, pre-committed answer that prevents me from derailing the project timeline. The Scope Fence decision tree is my first line of defense against the scope creep that kills solo projects.

> As a **solo developer managing my own time budget (CONST-006: 40–60 hours)**, I need a deferred features registry that captures good ideas without obligating me to implement them, so that I can say "not now, but documented for later" instead of either losing the idea or losing time implementing it prematurely. The registry preserves intellectual investment without spending implementation hours.

> As a **portfolio evaluator reviewing DocStratum**, I need evidence that the developer made deliberate, defensible scope decisions — not just "we ran out of time" but "we evaluated this against clear criteria and deferred it with rationale." The 32 OOS items with justifications, the Scope Fence decision tree, and the explicit exclusion statements demonstrate mature project management and engineering discipline.
