# v0.0.0 — Research & Discovery

> **Phase Goal:** Study the llms.txt ecosystem, analyze existing implementations, and synthesize best practices before writing a single line of code.
>

## Phase Overview

---

## Why Research First?

<aside>

**The Writer's Principle:** Never design a schema in isolation. Study the field, understand the conventions, then innovate where it matters.

</aside>

Skipping research leads to:

- Reinventing existing solutions poorly
- Missing established conventions
- Building incompatible implementations
- Solving problems nobody has

## Research Questions to Answer

### Specification

- [ ]  What is the official llms.txt specification?
- [ ]  What fields are required vs optional?
- [ ]  What's the versioning strategy?
- [ ]  Are there competing standards?

### Ecosystem

- [ ]  Who is already using llms.txt?
- [ ]  What patterns emerge across implementations?
- [ ]  What common mistakes do people make?
- [ ]  What's missing from existing implementations?

### Technical

- [ ]  What file formats are used (YAML, JSON, Markdown)?
- [ ]  How are large documentation sites handling this?
- [ ]  What tooling exists for validation/generation?
- [ ]  How do AI agents actually consume these files?

### Strategic

- [ ]  Where does llms.txt fit in the broader AI-docs landscape?
- [ ]  What related standards exist (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, [schema.org](http://schema.org))?
- [ ]  What's the adoption trajectory?
- [ ]  Who are the key players/voices in this space?

## Deliverables Checklist

- [ ]  `docs/[RESEARCH.md](http://RESEARCH.md)` — Consolidated research findings
- [ ]  `docs/[EXAMPLES.md](http://EXAMPLES.md)` — Annotated real-world examples
- [ ]  `docs/[REQUIREMENTS.md](http://REQUIREMENTS.md)` — What DocStratum must/should/could do
- [ ]  Research log with dated entries
- [ ]  Decision record: "Why we chose X over Y"

---

## Exit Criteria

This phase is **COMPLETE** when:

- [ ]  Official specification fully understood
- [ ]  At least 10 real-world examples analyzed
- [ ]  Best practices document drafted
- [ ]  Requirements for DocStratum defined
- [ ]  Confident to proceed with schema design (v0.1.2)

## Time Budget

<aside>

**Pro Tip:** Don't let research become procrastination. Set a hard stop at 5 hours. You can always refine later based on implementation learnings.
