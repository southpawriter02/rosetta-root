# v0.0.5 — Requirements Definition

> **Task:** Define clear requirements for what DocStratum must accomplish, informed by research.
> 

---

## Task Overview

This version converts all findings from v0.0.1–v0.0.4 research into a complete, implementable requirements specification. It is divided into four sub-parts: v0.0.5a (68 functional requirements), v0.0.5b (21 non-functional requirements + 6 constraints), v0.0.5c (scope boundaries and out-of-scope registry), and v0.0.5d (MVP definition with success criteria). Together, these documents define what DocStratum must do, how well it must do it, what it explicitly will not do, and how to verify that it's done.

---

## Requirements Framework

Using **MoSCoW prioritization**:

- **M**ust have — Critical for MVP
- **S**hould have — Important but not critical
- **C**ould have — Nice to have
- **W**on't have (this version) — Future scope

---

## Functional Requirements

68 formal requirements (FR-001 through FR-068) organized across 7 modules. See [v0.0.5a](RR-SPEC-v0.0.5a-functional-requirements-specification.md) for the complete specification.

### Schema & Validation

FR-001 to FR-012 (12 requirements): Pydantic models, 5-level validation pipeline (L0–L4), error reporting with line numbers and severity codes. 8 MUST, 4 SHOULD.

### Content Structure

FR-013 to FR-025 (13 requirements): 3-layer architecture (Master Index, Concept Map, Few-Shot Bank), cross-layer reference resolution, JSON/YAML export. 5 MUST, 6 SHOULD, 2 COULD.

### Agent Integration

FR-039 to FR-050 (12 requirements): Baseline and enhanced agents, system prompt injection, multi-provider LLM support, few-shot in-context learning, agent configuration. 6 MUST, 5 SHOULD, 1 COULD.

### Testing & Validation

FR-051 to FR-058 (8 requirements): A/B test harness, response comparison metrics, statistical significance, baseline definition, 4-category test query design. 6 MUST, 2 SHOULD.

### Demo & Visualization

FR-059 to FR-065 (7 requirements): Streamlit UI with file upload, side-by-side agent comparison, metrics display, settings panel. 2 MUST, 3 SHOULD, 2 COULD.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

21 formal requirements (NFR-001 through NFR-021) across 5 quality dimensions, plus 6 hard constraints (CONST-001 through CONST-006). See [v0.0.5b](RR-SPEC-v0.0.5b-non-functional-requirements-and-constraints.md) for the complete specification.

### Performance

NFR-001 to NFR-005: Parse time < 500ms, context build < 2s, agent latency < 8–12s, memory < 200MB. Calibrated to agent timeout budgets and real-world file size data from v0.0.2.

### Usability

NFR-006 to NFR-009: Clear CLI error messages with severity/code/remediation, 100% documentation coverage, grouped validation output, demo UI response < 200ms. Serves both developer and portfolio reviewer audiences.

### Maintainability

NFR-010 to NFR-013: Test coverage ≥ 80% for core modules (≥ 60% for UI), Black + Ruff compliance, < 15 direct dependencies, substantial inline documentation for complex algorithms.

### Compatibility

NFR-014 to NFR-018: Python 3.9+, multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Claude, LiteLLM), cross-OS (Linux, macOS, Windows), HTTPS-only for real URLs, input validation with 50MB max file size.

## Out of Scope (v0.6.0)

Explicitly NOT included in this version:

- [ ]  Auto-generation from existing docs
- [ ]  Web-based editor for llms.txt
- [ ]  Multi-language support
- [ ]  Production deployment (focus is portfolio)
- [ ]  SaaS/hosted version
- [ ]  Integration with docs platforms
- [ ]  Real-time sync with source docs

---

## Success Criteria

### MVP Definition

The project is successful if:

1. **Schema works** — Can validate a well-formed llms.txt
2. **Agent works** — Can create an enhanced agent with context
3. **Demo works** — Streamlit app shows A/B comparison
4. **Tests pass** — Validation tests demonstrate improvement
5. **Documented** — README and docs are complete

### Stretch Goals

If time permits:

- [ ]  Neo4j graph visualization
- [ ]  Deployed Streamlit demo
- [ ]  Blog post written
- [ ]  Video recorded
