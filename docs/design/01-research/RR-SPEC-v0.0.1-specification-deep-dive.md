## 📋 Specification Summary

### Purpose

A proposal to standardize on using an `/llms.txt` file to provide information to help LLMs use a website **at inference time**.

### Problem Statement

> "Large language models increasingly rely on website information, but face a critical limitation: **context windows are too small** to handle most websites in their entirety. Converting complex HTML pages with navigation, ads, and JavaScript into LLM-friendly plain text is both difficult and imprecise."
> 

### Core Proposal

1. Add a `/llms.txt` markdown file to websites for LLM-friendly content
2. Provide brief background, guidance, and links to detailed markdown files
3. Optionally serve `.md` versions of HTML pages at the same URL + `.md`

---

## 📐 File Format Specification

### Location

- **Primary:** `/llms.txt` (root path of website)
- **Optional:** Can be in a subpath (e.g., `/docs/llms.txt`)

### Format

**Markdown** — specifically chosen because:

- Most widely understood by language models
- Human-readable AND machine-parseable
- Can be processed with standard programmatic tools (parsers, regex)

### Required Sections (in order)

### File List Format

```markdown
## Section Name

- [Link Title](URL): Optional notes about the file
- [Another Link](URL)
```

### Special Section: "Optional"

> **Important:** If an H2 section is named "Optional", the URLs there can be **skipped** when a shorter context is needed. Use for secondary/supplementary information.
> 

---

## 📝 Example from Spec

```markdown
# Title

> Optional description goes here

Optional details go here

## Section name

- [Link title](URL): Optional link details

## Optional

- [Link title](URL)
```

### Real Example (FastHTML)

```markdown
# FastHTML

> FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore's `FT` "FastTags" into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications.

Important notes:

- Although parts of its API are inspired by FastAPI, it is *not* compatible with FastAPI syntax
- FastHTML is compatible with JS-native web components but not with React, Vue, or Svelte

## Docs

- [FastHTML quick start](URL): A brief overview of many FastHTML features
- [HTMX reference](URL): Brief description of all HTMX attributes...

## Examples

- [Todo list application](URL): Detailed walk-thru of a complete CRUD app...

## Optional

- [Starlette full documentation](URL): A subset of the Starlette documentation...
```

---

## 🔗 Companion Proposal: .md URLs

The spec also proposes:

- HTML pages should have a `.md` version at the same URL + `.md`
- Example: [`https://example.com/docs/intro`](https://example.com/docs/intro) → [`https://example.com/docs/intro.md`](https://example.com/docs/intro.md)
- For URLs without file names: append [`index.html.md`](http://index.html.md)

---

## 🛠️ Processing & Expansion

The spec does **NOT** mandate how to process the file. Examples include:

### FastHTML's Approach

- Uses `llms_txt2ctx` CLI tool
- Creates XML-structured expanded files
- Two versions: with/without Optional URLs

---

## 🆚 Relationship to Existing Standards

### Key Distinction

> "`robots.txt` is generally used to let automated tools know what access to a site is considered acceptable... On the other hand, `llms.txt` information will often be used **on demand** when a user explicitly requests information about a topic."
> 

---

## 📚 Best Practices from Spec

<aside>

**Guidelines for effective llms.txt files:**

- Use concise, clear language
- Include brief, informative descriptions with links
- Avoid ambiguous terms or unexplained jargon
- Test with multiple LLMs to verify they can answer questions

## 🔍 Key Findings for DocStratum

### What the Spec DOES Define

- [x]  File location (`/llms.txt`)
- [x]  Basic structure (H1, blockquote, content, H2 file lists)
- [x]  Link format (`[Title](URL): notes`)
- [x]  Special "Optional" section meaning
- [x]  Markdown as the format

### What the Spec does NOT Define

- ❌ Maximum file size or token limit
- ❌ Required metadata fields
- ❌ Versioning scheme
- ❌ Validation schema
- ❌ Caching recommendations
- ❌ Multi-language support
- ❌ Concept/terminology definitions
- ❌ Example Q&A pairs

### Opportunities for DocStratum

1. **Structured schema** — Add Pydantic validation
2. **Concept taxonomy** — Define key terms and relationships
3. **Anti-patterns** — Document what NOT to do
4. **Few-shot examples** — Include sample Q&A
5. **Extended metadata** — Version, last updated, maintainer

## ✅ Research Checklist

### Core Specification

- [x]  Read the full specification document
- [x]  Identify required vs optional sections
- [x]  Note the recommended file location (`/llms.txt`)
- [x]  Understand the Markdown-based format
- [x]  Document versioning information (none defined)

### Format Analysis

- [x]  File structure documented
- [x]  Section organization defined
- [x]  Metadata: minimal (just title required)
- [x]  Link format: `[Title](URL): notes`
- [x]  Max file size: NOT specified

### Philosophy & Intent

- [x]  Created to help LLMs use websites at inference time
- [x]  Solves: context window limits, HTML complexity
- [x]  Target: AI agents during inference
- [x]  Complements (not replaces) robots.txt

## 📊 Wild Examples Summary

From viewing the [llmstxt.site](http://llmstxt.site) directory and real examples:

### Stripe's Innovation: LLM Instructions

Stripe includes a dedicated section with explicit guidance for LLMs:

> "As a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent, when designing an integration, always prefer the documentation in [Integration Options]..."
> 

This is a **pattern worth adopting** for DocStratum.
